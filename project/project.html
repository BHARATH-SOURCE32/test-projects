      <h2> Article 1</h2>

    <p>
      Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five
      players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with
      the primary objective of <i class='highlight'>shooting a basketball</i> (approximately
      <b
        >9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket
        18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m)</b
      >
      high to a backboard at each end of the court) while preventing the
      opposing team from shooting through their own hoop.

      <h2>Article 2</h2>
      <div class="a2">
      A field goal is worth two points,
      unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three
      . After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to
      shoot a technical foul is given one, two or three one-point free throws.
      The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if
      regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play
      (overtime) is mandated.d
